# Asteroids

This was my solution to a JavaScript practice exercise earlier this year when I was relatively new to JavasScript. The purpose was to become familiar with the structure of prototypical inheritance. The classes are written in ES5 syntax so that inheritance must be arranged manually. Objects are rendered using the Canvas API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
